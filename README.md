# Requirementï¼š

1. Four slides
2. One visualization per slide
3. A 1-2 sentence explanation of each slide
4. The SQL query used to create the data used in the visualization.
5. Each SQL query needs to include **one or more aggregation** . This could be a COUNT, AVG, SUM, or other aggregation.
6. May choose to use queries that were motivated by the questions on the previous concepts, or you may choose four entirely new questions. However, if you use any of the previous queries, they must be those that had a **JOIN as stated in the Rubric**.

# Important Notes:
1. I try to answer to many non essential questions that may be not vital to the project requirements but i did it for practise. 
2. These questions and answers in folder **Extra Questions**
3. The **QueryVisulaization file** has my code for visualizing the four quries by python and it library Matplotlib. 
4. In **CSV Queries** there are the CSVs for the four queries.
